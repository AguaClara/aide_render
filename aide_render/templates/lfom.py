class LFOM:
    r""" This is an example class for an LFOM. It already has a lot of features built in,
    such as constants that go in the class attribute section (defaults), and methods.
    As well as an instantiation process that can be used to set custom values.

    Attributes
    ----------
    These are the default values for an LFOM. To overwrite, pass these into the bod
    (Basis Of Design) variable into the constructor.

    ratio_safety : float
        Percent above the top hole safety height.
    sdr : float
        Standard dimensional ratio of the LFOM pipe.
    S_orifice : length
        Minimum distance between orifices.
    hl : length
        Headloss of the LFOM



    Methods
    -------
    All these methods are just imported from the aide_design lfom. This would
    replace that.

    n_lfom_rows(q, hl_lfom)
        number of rows of orifices in an lfom. This could be defined directly
        within the LFOM class here instead of in lfom_prefab... just copy & paste!
    nom_diam_lfom_pipe(q, hl_lfom)
        nominal diameter of the lfom pipe.
    orifice_diameter(q, hl_lfom, mat.DIAM_DRILL_ENG)
        orifice diameter
    n_lfom_orifices_fusion
        List of numbers of rows

    Examples
    --------

    >>> my_lfom = LFOM(HP(20, u.L/u.s))
    >>> from aide_render.builder import extract_types
    >>> lfom_design_dict = extract_types(my_lfom, [DP], [])

# This is a template docstring. Much like a function docstring, it will
# specify the expected variables that are already defined in the template's
# namespace. This should be written as a numpy docstring:

# Generate a cube with custom side lengths.
#
# Parameters
# ==========
# side_lengths: pint quantity of length dimension
#   specify the side_length of the generated block.
#
# Returns
# =======
# A YAML specifying dimensions for a block to be created.
